# Automated-blood-donors-finder-bot

## DESCRIPTION
In most case of accidents or any other medical emergency situations,there's always a need for blood donors. Statistics
show that every two seconds, someone is in need of Blood. Blood banks are the main sources of blood which receives blood from various donors and
monitors the blood groups data base, when in case of emergencies they make it available to the
hospital whenever needed. The major problem faced here is availability of blood and if not, finding
the right blood donor at the right time. There is general delay in the process of finding the right
donor amongst thousands of people.
“Tedious repetition is always a good argument for automation” .
This project is an attempt to intoduce a Smart
Blood Donor Finder. A simple action of pressing a button gets the geo-location of the user
who is in need of the blood. A slighter modified replica for geo tagging has been used to find available donors nearby the victim and later the model automatically auto-generates mass messages to all the available donors reducing the tedious workload.
